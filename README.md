# FPS-engine-raylib
This is a simple 3D FPS zombie survival I wrote in C using this very nice library called 'raylib'.

You can get Raylib from:
https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git

## Running the program
You must download the 'resources' folder with all it's content to be able to compile and run the program.
