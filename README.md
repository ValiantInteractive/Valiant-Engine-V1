# FPS-engine-raylib
This is a simple Zombie Survival FPS game I wrote in C using a very nice library for creating games called Raylib.

You can get Raylib from:
https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git

### Running the program
You must download the /resources folder with all it's contents to be able to compile and run the program. 
Please note that music.mp3 is just a blank file since I don't own the rights for the original audio track that was previously used in the game. 
Will the game run and just remain silent or will it crash? I haven't tested it out yet so I really don't know. 
Either way, I will patch it in the future once I have more time for these kinds of projects.
#### Adding music in the game:
1. Grab an mp3 file of your choice and name it music.mp3
2. Place it in the resources folder replacing the blank file
3. Compile and run.
4. Now you can play the game with your favorite song looping in the background. Awesome!
